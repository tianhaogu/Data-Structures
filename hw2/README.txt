DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Calculate average point and standard deviation point for each event (as well as the total point)



RESULTS FROM 3RD STATISTIC:
DECATHLETE POINTS                   100     LJ     SP     HJ    400   110H     DT     PV     JT   1500    TOTAL
Average:                          835.8  783.1  678.6  696.9  646.7  652.6  553.3  485.8  477.9  424.1   6234.9
Standard Deviation:                71.8  239.1  237.5  246.9  357.3  410.8  352.7  409.6  368.8  323.4   2552.1

Output can be seen in submitty under custom command. (also print all points of each athelete but without pasting them here)
From the result we can see that 110m hurdles and Pole Vault have the largest standard deviations which means that these two events
play the largest role in deciding total points(ranking), and the result quite correspond with this. But such statistics have a little problems here,
that is, some of the events have many zeros which means some part of the atheletes haven't taken part in these events.
When calculating average and standard deviation, no matter whether we exclude or include these zeros, the exact distribution of points of such events
cannot be viewed very clearly and correctly.
